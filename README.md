## üîë API Authentication

The application requires a Graph API Token for authentication. The implementation uses a proxy approach for security:

1. Requests are made to a local API route (`/api/token-proxy`)
2. The proxy adds authentication headers and forwards to the Graph Token API
3. This keeps API keys secure and avoids CORS issues

```typescript
// Example of how API requests are made
const url = new URL("/api/token-proxy", window.location.origin);
url.searchParams.append("path", `transfers/evm/${contractAddress}`);
url.searchParams.append("network_id", selectedNetwork);

const response = await fetch(url.toString(), {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
        Accept: "application/json",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    cache: "no-store",
});
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. Make sure it's included in your `.gitignore`.

## üåê Supported Networks

The API supports the following networks:

-   `mainnet`: Ethereum Mainnet
-   `arbitrum-one`: Arbitrum
-   `base`: Base
-   `bsc`: Binance Smart Chain
-   `optimism`: Optimism
-   `matic`: Polygon
-   `unichain`: Unichain (for some endpoints)

## üß© API Endpoints

The components interact with these Token API endpoints:

| Component         | Endpoint                             | Description              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |

        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            Accept: "application/json",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        cache: "no-store",
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
        const errorText = await response.text();
        console.error("‚ùå API Error Response:", errorText);
        throw new Error(
            `API request failed with status ${response.status}: ${errorText}`
        );
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    // Process data...
} catch (err) {
    const errorMessage =
        err instanceof Error ? err.message : "An error occurred";
    console.error("‚ùå Error fetching data:", err);
    setError(errorMessage);
    // Handle UI state...
}
```

<h4 align="center">
  <a href="https://docs.scaffoldeth.io">Documentation</a> |
  <a href="https://scaffoldeth.io">Website</a>
</h4>

üß™ An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

-   ‚úÖ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
-   ü™ù **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
-   üß± [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
-   üî• **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
-   üîê **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.

![Debug Contracts tab](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/assets/55535804/b237af0c-5027-4849-a5c1-2e31495cccb1)

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

-   [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd my-dapp-example
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

-   Edit your smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
-   Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
-   Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

## üöÄ Setup The Graph Integration

Now that we have spun up our blockchain, started our frontend application and deployed our smart contract, we can start setting up our subgraph and utilize The Graph!

> Before following these steps be sure Docker is running!

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Clean up any old data and spin up our docker containers ‚úÖ

First run the following to clean up any old data. Do this if you need to reset everything.

```
yarn subgraph:clean-node
```

> We can now spin up a graph node by running the following command‚Ä¶ üßë‚ÄçüöÄ

```
yarn subgraph:run-node
```

This will spin up all the containers for The Graph using docker-compose. You will want to keep this window open at all times so that you can see log output from Docker.

> As stated before, be sure to keep this window open so that you can see any log output from Docker. üîé

> NOTE FOR LINUX USERS: If you are running Linux you will need some additional changes to the project.

##### Linux Only

**For hardhat**

Update your package.json in packages/hardhat with the following command line option for the hardhat chain.

```
"chain": "hardhat node --network hardhat --no-deploy --hostname 0.0.0.0"
```

**For foundry**

Update your package.json in packages/foundry with the following command line option for the anvil chain.

```
"chain": "anvil --host 0.0.0.0 --config-out localhost.json",
```

Save the file and then restart your chain in its original window.

```
yarn chain
```

Redeploy your smart contracts.

```
yarn deploy
```

You might also need to add a firewall exception for port 8432. As an example for Ubuntu... run the following command.

```
sudo ufw allow 8545/tcp
```

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create and ship our subgraph ‚úÖ

Now we can open up a fifth window to finish setting up The Graph. üòÖ In this fifth window we will create our local subgraph!

> Note: You will only need to do this once.

```
yarn subgraph:create-local
```

> You should see some output stating your subgraph has been created along with a log output on your graph-node inside docker.

Next we will ship our subgraph! You will need to give your subgraph a version after executing this command. (e.g. 0.0.1).

```
yarn subgraph:local-ship
```

> This command does the following all in one‚Ä¶ üöÄüöÄüöÄ

-   Copies the contracts ABI from the hardhat/deployments folder
-   Generates the networks.json file
-   Generates AssemblyScript types from the subgraph schema and the contract ABIs.
-   Compiles and checks the mapping functions.
-   ‚Ä¶ and deploy a local subgraph!

> If you get an error ts-node you can install it with the following command

```
npm install -g ts-node
```

You should get a build completed output along with the address of your Subgraph endpoint.

```
Build completed: QmYdGWsVSUYTd1dJnqn84kJkDggc2GD9RZWK5xLVEMB9iP

Deployed to http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/scaffold-eth/your-contract/graphql

Subgraph endpoints:
Queries (HTTP):     http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/scaffold-eth/your-contract
```

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Test your Subgraph ‚úÖ

Go ahead and head over to your subgraph endpoint and take a look!

> Here is an example query‚Ä¶

```
  {
    greetings(first: 25, orderBy: createdAt, orderDirection: desc) {
      id
      greeting
      premium
      value
      createdAt
      sender {
        address
        greetingCount
      }
    }
  }
```

> If all is well and you've sent a transaction to your smart contract then you will see a similar data output!

#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Create Graph Client Artifacts ‚úÖ

The Graph Client is a tool used to query GraphQL based applications and contains a lot of advanced features, such as client side composition or automatic pagination. A complete list of features and goals of this project can be found [here].(https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client?tab=readme-ov-file#features-and-goals)

In order to utilize Graph-Client in our application, we need to build the artifacts needed for our frontend. To do this simply run...

```
yarn graphclient:build
```

After doing so, navigate to http://localhost:3000/subgraph and you should be able to see the GraphQL rendered in your application. If you don't see anything, make sure you've triggered an event in your smart contract.

If you want to look at the query code for this, it can be found the component located in the subgraph folder `packages/nextjs/app/subgraph/_components/GreetingsTable.tsx`

#### ‚úÖ Side Quest: Run a Matchstick Test ‚úÖ

Matchstick is a [unit testing framework](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/unit-testing-framework/), developed by [LimeChain](https://limechain.tech/), that enables subgraph developers to test their mapping logic in a sandboxed environment and deploy their subgraphs with confidence!

The project comes with a pre-written test located in `packages/subgraph/tests/asserts.test.ts`

To test simply type....

```
yarn subgraph:test
```

> This will run `graph test` and automatically download the needed files for testing.

You should receive the following output.

```
Fetching latest version tag...
Downloading release from https://github.com/LimeChain/matchstick/releases/download/0.6.0/binary-macos-11-m1

```

> NOTE: If you get an error, you may trying passing `-d` flag `yarn subgraph:test -d`. This will run matchstick in docker container.

## Shipping to Subgraph Studio üöÄ

> NOTE: This step requires [deployment of contract](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts) to live network. Checkout list of [supported networks](https://thegraph.com/docs/networks).

1. Update the `packages/subgraph/subgraph.yaml` file with your contract address, network name, start block number(optional) :

    ```diff
    ...
    -     network: localhost
    +     network: sepolia
          source:
            abi: YourContract
    +       address: "0x54FE7f8Db97e102D3b7d86cc34D885B735E31E8e"
    +       startBlock: 5889410
    ...
    ```

    TIP: For `startBlock` you can use block number of your deployed contract, which can be found by visiting deployed transaction hash in blockexplorer.

2. Create a new subgraph on [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio) and get "SUBGRAPH SLUG" and "DEPLOY KEY".

3. Authenticate with the graph CLI:

    ```sh
    yarn graph auth --studio <DEPLOY KEY>
    ```

4. Deploy the subgraph to TheGraph Studio:

    ```sh
    yarn graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH SLUG>
    ```

    Once deployed, the CLI should output the Subgraph endpoints. Copy the HTTP endpoint and test your queries.

5. Update `packages/nextjs/components/ScaffoldEthAppWithProviders.tsx` to use the above HTTP subgraph endpoint:
    ```diff
    - const subgraphUri = "http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/scaffold-eth/your-contract";
    + const subgraphUri = 'YOUR_SUBGRAPH_ENDPOINT';
    ```
